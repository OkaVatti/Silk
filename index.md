## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/OkaVatti/Silk/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

For more details see [Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/OkaVatti/Silk/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

<h1><center>Welcome</center></h1>
<h1><center>To Project Silk</center></h1>
<p1><center>
	For those who are unfamiliar, <b>Project Silk</b> is a Web project. The main goail in the end is to basically create a huge repository of websites that people can use, sign-up for, or gather information without having to worry about their data being stolen from them by the sites.
</center></p1>

<p1><center>Project Silk is a huge repository of websites that can be viewed at www.silkabyss.com</center></p1>

<h1><center>The Team</center></h1>
<p1><center>
	The team for <b>Project Silk</b> is no more than a 1 person at the moment. It's creator <i>Parker</i> has been doing most of the coding on his own. So the coding process is both unhealthy and a little slower than it would be with a whole team.
</center></p1>

<p1><center>
	<i>Parker</i> is happy to take people in and have them help with the Project. Contributing to the <b>Project Silk</b> is currently the best way to support it since there's currently way of funding the Project. As long as you know some HTML, CSS, JS, or PHP, your help is valued and appreciated. 
</center></p1>

<h1><center>The Why?</center></h1>
<p1><center>
	At some point in time Parker got really angry that it was nearly impossible to find a good ass startpage that they could use. A startpage that worked for them. Annoyed with Firefox, Google, and even DuckDuckGo's startpages. Parker decided
</center></p1>

<p1><i>"You know what? Fuck this. I'm Making my own startpage."</i></p1>

<p1><center>And so they went onto make one.
The decision to make their own startpage eventually spiraled out of control and they began basically making their own little sites.</center></p1>

<h5><center>Before Project Silk</center></h5>

<p1><center>At first <b>Project Silk</b> wasn't even an idea, <i>Parker</i> just randomly decided one day to pick a premade startpage off of [Github](https://github.com/migueravila/Bento), fork it, and edit it to their liking. While doing this <i>Parker</i> ended up learning a bit about HTML, CSS, and a little bit of JS. After working on the project for some time, learning about some cool ways to display things with HTML and CSS, they decided to name the project <i>Tokyo</i>. This naming led into <i>Parker's</i> trend of naming each startpage after popular cities and capitals.</center></p1>
