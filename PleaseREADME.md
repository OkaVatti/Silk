## if you don't want to break anything

<p1>Hey there! This is a little file that I hope you decide to read if you don't want to break anything important.</p1>

# The Center

This is a pretty simple but very important part of the Spiderweb. The Center provides virtually everything from CSS, to JS, to basic PHP for you to use. It's all stored in their respective core folders for any Spiderweb or website developer to use.
	
# Omniverse
"what is the Omniverse?"
the Omniverse is a huge thing of folders containing JS and CSS written by official maintainers and the Community. 

## Why Omniverse ?

The main reason for having the Omniverse is mostly to just have a place for people to put their custom CSS and JS in. If you have a cool JS Module or maybe you just have similar CSS through out all your websites. You can store them in Omniverse, grab them fast, quick, and easy. 
	
Omniverse isn't meant to be used for everything though. In order to make sure that it doesn't get big and messy we're making sure that the CSS that gets let into official and community are small and mainly dedicated to smaller websites. If we let them get huge then we would eventually have an issue with storage. if you were to self host the whole thing on your system

# Web 3.0 ?

for those who don't know, Web 3.0 is basically Web 2.0, but decentralized and secure. With users connecting to each other through the a modded version of **hypercore** that automatically masks your IP. This allows others to connect to each other and share information, thoughts, and ideas faster. 

Say you wanted to host your own website, cheap and free, didn't want to bother with a domain. You could share your **hyperdrive** with peers and get your ideas out there faster and easier with the benefit of it being secure. 
	
The Spiderweb is one of the starting projects that is being built for Web 3.0. 

# React ???	

later, still need to learn that.
