# Silk

## [Disclaimer!]

The project isn't finished yet, but the creator is working on creating more websites for people check out.
As of right now there is no real server hosting either. Most of these websites are ment to basically be self hosted by you using either Beaker Browsers p2p hypercore protocol, or with whatever other way you find. As long as you have the sites accessable to you, and there's been little modification to the files, they should work as intended
The the most we currently have at the moment are a few files that you can check out on your own system.

## [About]

Silk, formerly Spiderweb, is an open-source project with the goal to recreate a handfull of websites for fun. Eventually leading to something that is usable as anyones daily driver. This was also probably one of the best excuses to just go off and learn JavaScript and HTML. Feel free to fork the project and add your own website to the project. We'd be more than happy to merge it in. Just remember to follow our rules when making an addition site.

We ask that you please refrain from purchasing domains and hosting some of these websites on them. These are ment for local use only and should stay as is within **_project abyss_** until further notice.

## Check out the project

If you wanna check out some of the sites and shit you can check them out by cloning the repository and dragging aand dropping the HTML file(s) into your web browser of choice. Just remember that they're all currently in their _Work In Progress_ / _Development_ phases and there's not much to look at yet

`git clone https://github.com/OkaVatti/Silk.git`

if you're using beaker, this process is gonna be pretty easy and straight forward

### for beaker

1. click on the 3 lines in the top right corner
2. click "new hyperdrive from folder"
3. choose Silk as the folder/directory you're like to like said hyperdrive too

if you're using any other browser then you could either manually bookmark the sites so you caa access them easier, or create your own local search engine to search for files easier.
