        <p> reifetch is one of my former passion projects.
          It is basically a spiritual successor to the popular system info
          fetch tool, neofetch. If we are being 100% honest here I made reifetch
          because I was sick and tired of basically being forced to use such a
          bloated, overengineered piece of software. So i forked it, and fixed it.
          and now we have reifetch </p>

        <p>
          If you take a quick look at my github and make the poor decision of looking
          down at my pinned repos. You'll be quick to notice a certain repo by the name
          of "fuck-cpp". This repo contains the worlds simplest C++ script that, quite
          literally, just prints out the definition of "fuck" in your terminal. Why would
          anyone need this? I don't know, but it's kinda funny and I think it's a good
          reminder as to why I shouldn't have access to a computer.

        <h2 id="lcolco">Silk</h2>
        <h5 id="lcolco">basically what you're looking at</h5>
        <p>
          Silk is basically the entire source code of this website. It contains 95% of 
          everything that is on this website, excluding The Gateway, secrets, and the 
          PHP code which has yet to be added to the website. Silk is no more than just
          a little box for me to maintain, organize, and deploy whenever I need. Say I 
          eventually have to switch server hostin providers or, worst case senario, I 
          have to move everything to my own servers. I can easily deploy my website 
          within a matter of seconds. Making updates extremely fast an easy. The only
          downside to this is I'm not sure how well this will scale.

        <p>
          Recently I've been taking another shot at writing. Just a bunch of 
          unfinished ideas at the moment, but when I'm writing them I feel happy almost.
          When I'm writing I feel content. Like everything is fine. Writing about scary 
          things is also something I like doing. Especially in the dark while watching 
          creepy ass short films. At the moment, I am currently writing a short-ish story
          based on the Mandela Catalogue by Alex Kister. If you're interested in reading
          the prologue to Uncanny, follow the link provided below

          <h2 id="rcolco">About Me</h2>
          <p>Hi! I'm Parker I'm transgender MTF. I'm currently attending high school and I'm 
            thinking about going into web-development or cyber-security in the future. My hobbies 
            insclude coding, playing video games, skateboarding, and making youtube videos. I'm 
            tring to get better at coding and right now I'm focussing on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
            Which is what you are mainly seeing here on this poorly put together blog.

          <h2 id="rcolco">How I'm feeling</h2>
          <p>
            As of right now I am not doing do good. I don't want to get to much into it because it's 
            honestly none of your business and nothing you should worry about. But I'm not mentally ok
            at the moment. The real world just hurts a lot right now. I feel lost. I don't know what to
            do and I feel like I have no one to come and save me from this hell. I feel like I have lost
            everything. I feel like nobody around me truely loves. I just want to feel loved.
          </p>
