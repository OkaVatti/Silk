# Welcome to Silk
We encourage fellow users and onlookers of the website to contribute their code to the website.

As long as you have experience programming in <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b>, <b>JS</b>, <b>PHP</b>. or <b>SQL</b>. You are welcome into the community.

There are a few things you should take note of thoughbefore you start

## Guidelines for contributing your webpages.
If you are considering contributing to the repository make sure you follow these guidelines.

1. Your code must be <b>readable</b> by an actual human. We're not robots. <br/>
     - Good examples of <b>readable</b> code can be found <b>[here](https://github.com/OkaVatti/Readable-Code)</b> <!-- Need to create that last repo -->
    
2. Your Page(s) must have a responsive design.<br/>
     - This can easily be done with some <b>CSS</b>. Some good examples can be found <b>[here](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_mediaqueries.asp)</b>
     - If you want to learn more about responsive design you can learn about it <b>[here](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_intro.asp)</b> and <b>[there](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Responsive_Design)</b>

3. If your page uses <b>JavaScript</b>, we encourage you to make sure it is the best implementation of that <b>JavaScript</b>.<br/>
     - "If it <i><b>ZOOMS</b></i> it <i><b>BLOOMS</b></i>"
     
4. Document (mostly) everything <br/>
     - If you're creating a larger page or a page that contains some unorthodox, Please, Please make some documentation for it.<br/> 
     - It just takes a little bit of time and it's not that hard if you're working on it at the same time as your actual code.<br/>
     
     - <i><b>Example: [Silk-KISS](https://github.com/OkaVatti/Silk/tree/main/Abyss/Sites/Linux/KISS) contains a pretty uncommon way of [converting](https://github.com/OkaVatti/Silk/blob/main/Abyss/Sites/Linux/KISS/make) it's pages from .txt -> .html<br/>
     because [Dylan](https://github.com/dylanaraps) thought it would be cool and quirky. So Parker is working on documenting everything<br/> 
     that has to do with the site, it's pages, and how everything is achieved in that secion of the site</i></b>

5. Just be nice
     - Parker's not gonna ask you to act professional or anything. Just be nice and kind to other contributors. it's not that<br/>
     hard. Just be nice
        - We don't tolerate hate speach of any kinda. Not in code, not in PR's, nowhere.  
        - Slurs of any form aren't allowed. Just no. I shouldn't have to put this here but I've met several people who simply<br/>
        don't understand that that's not okay.
